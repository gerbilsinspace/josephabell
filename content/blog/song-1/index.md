I've started messing around with MuseScore 3. This is pretty simple piece of piano music, no chords to speak of, just single notes to plunk away on at each hand.

I decided to try to use the random2 plugin, which produces a randomly generated score. It originally generated the score in 3/4, but it fit better in 4/4. I added a little of structure by introducing semibreves at regular stages, and then started fiddling with the notes until I liked how the bass and treble played together.

I then exported to pdf and mp3. Needless to say it is midi piano playing the piece, but I'd love to try and play the piece on ukulele soon.
